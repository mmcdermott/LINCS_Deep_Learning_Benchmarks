# LINCS (GSE92742) Deep Learning Benchmarks
A collection of benchmark tasks and results for the LINCS dataset.

To access the fully processed dataset (though fully derived from public data), including all cross validation folds, exactly as was used in this work, contact [mmd@mit.edu](mailto:mmd@mit.edu)

We performed some statistical analysis of the hyperparameter search. One notable finding not discussed in the paper that adds additional credence to the statistically significant preference of the GCNNs for the more raw, Level 4 data is the following:
